# What command to run to open a HTTP(S) URL.
# Set to "default" to try to guess the browser, or set to "off" to not open HTTP(S) URLs.
# If a command is set, than the URL will be added (in quotes) to the end of the command.

#
# The best to define a command is using a string array.
# Examples:
# http = ["firefox"]
# http = ["custom-browser", "--flag", "--option=2"]
# http = ["/path/with spaces/in it/firefox"]
#
# Using just a string will also work, but it is deprecated,

[url-handlers]
# Allows setting the commands to run for various URL schemes.
# E.g. to open FTP URLs with FileZilla set the following key:
#   ftp = "filezilla"
# You can set any scheme to "off" or "" to disable handling it, or
# just leave the key unset.
#
# DO NOT use this for setting the HTTP command.
# Use the http setting in the "a-general" section above.

# no handler is defined.

[proxies]
# Allows setting a Gemini proxy for different schemes.
# The settings are similar to the url-handlers section above.
# E.g. to open a gopher page by connecting to a Gemini proxy server:
#   gopher = "example.com:123"
#
# Port 1965 is assumed if no port is specified.
#
# NOTE: These settings override any external handlers specified in
# the url-handlers section.
#
# Note that HTTP and HTTPS are treated as separate protocols here.
