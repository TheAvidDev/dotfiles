# Programs
This repository contains configuration files for many programs that I regularly use on a day to day basis. I've also given brief descriptions of what each program does so you don't have to wonder what something is - and because you might like something and want try it out. If you'd like me to style an application that isn't listed here, submit an issue and I'll try my best. Feel free to also make a Pull Request if you've styled an application with the same theme and would like to add it here. The following configuration files exist:
 - [`sway`](https://swaywm.org) is a tiling Wayland compositor which serves as a drop-in replacement of i3.
 - [`waybar`](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) is a highly customizable Wayland bar for Sway and Wlroots based compositors.
# Installation
### Distro
I personally use Arch Linux, but there's nothing specific to these config files that shouldn't work on other distributions. Be aware, however, that installation procedures for the individual packages will certainly be different and that the _locations_ of config files _may_ be different. If you would like to install Arch Linux follow the directions on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide). I personally used [Anarchy Installer](https://anarchyinstaller.org/) to install Arch and some important packages, but it is neither necessary, nor entirely recommended.

### Fonts
All the applications have been setup to use the [Cozette](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette) font, so follow the instructions on its Github for installation.

### Procedure
First, clone the repo, probably into your home directory located at `/home/username` or with the shortcut `~`.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheAvidDev/dotfiles.git
```
